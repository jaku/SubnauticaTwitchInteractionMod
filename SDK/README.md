# Crowd Control SDK folder

**No longer required for building.** The mod builds without the Crowd Control SDK.

`SubCrowdControl.cs` is loaded directly by the Crowd Control app when you use "Load Pack Source" – the app compiles it with its own SDK. The mod connects to Crowd Control via raw TCP/JSON.
